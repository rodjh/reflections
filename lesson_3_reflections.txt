When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to use a remote repository when working with others, especially someone that I cannot easily share files with in-person (e.g., they live in another state). Other benefits of using a remote repository include 1) backing up my work to another source so that if my computer crashes, I will have a backup copy on GitHub; and 2) if I want to share my files as quickly as possible with another collaborator or user.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It is better to pull changes manually because it gives the user better control over the files. If I was editing one of the files locally and another user made a change to that file on GitHub, I might not want GitHub to try to change the file immediately, especially if there will be any merge conflicts. If Git automatically pulled from the database whenever a change was made, users would have to stop their work flow to check what each change was resulting in the users being less productive (i.e., the constant updates would be distracting).
